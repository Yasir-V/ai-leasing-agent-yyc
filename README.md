# ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤– AI Voice Leasing Agent (Demo) ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–

This is a voice-based AI leasing agent I built as a 4th-year Computer Science student.

It uses a trained ChatGPT model to act as a virtual assistant, answering incoming phone calls, handling leasing-related questions, and booking appointments 
directly into a connected Google Calendar.

The agent mimics how a real leasing assistant would talk: it answers naturally, gathers lead info, and proposes available tour times based on a live calendar.
